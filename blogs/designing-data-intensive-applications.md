- Low Redundancy: Reduces costs but increases risk of data loss.

## 4. Balancing Availability, Consistency, and Speed

### The CAP Theorem

The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can only achieve two out of three: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

Definitions:

- Consistency: All nodes see the same data at the same time.
- Availability: Every request receives a response, regardless of success.
- Partition Tolerance: The system continues to operate despite network partitions.
  Trade-offs:
- CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance): Prioritizes data accuracy but may sacrifice availability during network issues.
- AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance): Ensures the system remains operational but may return stale data.
- CA (Consistency + Availability): Rare in distributed systems, as network partitions are inevitable.

Choosing the Right Model
Based on your application's needs, decide which aspect to prioritize:

- Banking Systems: Consistency is critical to prevent errors in transactions.
- Social Media: Availability and partition tolerance are often prioritized to keep the system responsive.
